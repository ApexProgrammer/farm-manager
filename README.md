# 🚜 Farm Manager

Welcome to **Farm Manager**! This is an all-in-one farm management desktop application created using C and GTK4. It's designed to help you manage all aspects of your farm with ease and efficiency.

## 📦 Dependencies

Before running the application, you need to install GTK4. You can do this using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev
```
## 🏃‍♀️ Running the Application
If you don’t have make installed on your system, you can install it using the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install make
```
Once you have make installed, navigate to the farm-manager directory and type:
```bash
make all
```
This command compiles the GTK4 code along with the other files included in the project, creating an executable named app.

To run the executable, use the following command:
```bash
./app
```
